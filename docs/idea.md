# Idea

Right now i just want to play around and try out the grok model which is free on openrouter

# Context

I've never used open router and i want to try it out. playing w/ a free model also interests me. I expect the freeness will be short lived

It's thanksgiving!

# Goals

Wht could we do? idk. having something be _free_ makes me want to have it do a lot of work .. not sure what that work could be but we can have it done _free_!

Author a book? Write out everything it knows? the possibilities are endless!
